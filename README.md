## App Description

On The Map is an app that allows udacity students to share their location and a URL with their fellow students. To visualize this data, On The Map uses a map with pins for location and pin annotations for student names and URLs. By tapping on the pin users can see a URL for something the student finds interesting. The user is able to add their own data by posting a string that can be geocoded to a location, and a URL.
